            Jamia Millia Islamia, an institution originally established at Aligarh in United Provinces, 
            India in 1920 became a Central University by an act of the Indian Parliament in 1988. 
            In Urdu language, Jamia means ‘University’, and Millia means ‘National’.

            The story of its growth from a small institution in the pre-independence India to a central 
            university located in New Delhi—offering integrated education from nursery to research in 
            specialized areas—is a saga of dedication, conviction and vision of a people who worked 
            against all odds and saw it growing step by step. They “built up the Jamia Millia stone 
            by stone and sacrifice by sacrifice,” said Sarojini Naidu, the nightingale of India.
